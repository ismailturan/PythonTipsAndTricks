Check this tread on reddit:

## [Why do you use Pandas instead of SQL?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1tqjt4/why_do_you_use_pandas_instead_of_sql/)

> so i guess to answer the question, pandas is used to take weak relations between various data sources and then strengthens those relations by fitting the clean data into a SQL data schema.
